          <h1>1.Education</h1>
     <h3>Good Morning to one and all present here! Today I am here to deliver a speech about education. It is usually a belief that education is the foundation for all-round development. Life is based on development and that developing and growing is life. If we describe this view into the perspective of education, we can sum up that education is the all-round development of the individual’s personality. Thus, education is nothing but all-round development of the individual’s personality. Education is a process of man-making. Hence, education is necessary for all.</h3>     
      <h2>Its Importance</h2>
<p>As per the report of the Kothari Commission, “the destiny of India is being shaped in its classrooms.” Education ingrain civic and social responsibility among everyone. India is a land of diversities. Therefore, in order to bring unity, education is a means for emotional integration. We cannot do without any kind of education. Education is an essential aspect of human development. Education is a means of achieving a world of peace, justice, freedom, and equality for all. Thus, education is extremely necessary for all. No good life is possible without education.<br>It indorses the intelligence of human beings, develops his skill, and enables him to be industrious. It ensures his progress. Education also channelizes the undeveloped capacities, attitude, interest, urges and needs of the individual into desirable channels. The individual can adjust and modify his environment with the help of education as per his need.</p>

         <h1>2.Air pollution</h1>
<h3>My Greetings to everybody present over here and thanks for giving your precious time. Today I would like to deliver a speech on Air Pollution which has become a major challenge in recent times. In spite of a monologue, I would like it to be a fruitful interaction, hence your views are welcome. Air pollution means mixing of external hazardous gases and particulate matter in the air, which ultimately route inside our body through inhalation. These gradually lead to respiratory disorders and hence affect the health of human beings. Hence nowadays air pollution is becoming a major concern for humanity.</h3>
         <h2>Its causes</h2>
<p>There could be various causes of air pollution in today’s world. The world is developing at the cost of the environment. Today’s society in view of modernization is neglecting the mother nature and thereby adopting the lifestyle which ultimately cost us on our health.</p>
<p>The number of vehicles on road has increased tremendously in the past few decades, hence the emission level has also gone up. This can be very well seen by an increase in ppm-level. The severe pollution level in Delhi is an alarming situation for all of us.<br>Also, the smoke coming out of factories or the poisonous gases coming out of chemical factories are polluting the air. We have seen one major tragedy of air pollution in the form of Bhopal Gas Tragedy. The increase in usage of Air conditioners in homes is also a cause of air pollution.</p>
         <h2>Its effect</h2>
<p>Also, the different dangerous gases or smoke, when enters the pregnant ladies, cause the unborn child to come in contact with it before taking the birth. These children tend to have a high possibility of respiratory diseases as compared to other children.<br>The decrease in trees and plants leads to an imbalance in nature. It causes Global warming and depletion of the Ozone layer. Global warming leads to an imbalance of the natural cycle and hence de freezing of polar ice, which is again a foreseen danger. The depletion of the ozone layer allows the infrared rays to enter our atmosphere, thereby causing skin diseases.<br>The air pollution is affecting the animals as well. It causes acid rains which leads to the death of a lot of animals and marine creatures. Increasing allergic patients nowadays are due to air pollution only. Asthma is affecting the people of all age groups starting from 0 years of age.</p>
